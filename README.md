Feel free to explorer my GitHub profile and check out some of my projects! I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow, so if you have any suggestions or feedback, I'd love to hear it.

Interested in getting in contact? Feel free to reach out [here](https://eglenn.dev/), or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://eglenn.app/in).
